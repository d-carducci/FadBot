# FadBot
A Twitter bot for automated Fallen London world qualities updates.
This bot was built to automate posts on the [Bone Market Updates](https://twitter.com/bonemarketfads) twitter account and uses Tweepy to tweet the weekly updates. It's in a fairly early stage of development but it's very close to being functional.

Many thanks to the [Fallen London Wiki](https://fallenlondon.wiki/wiki/Fallen_London_Wiki) staff and users for providing such a useful resource, which I used as reference for the in-game info.
